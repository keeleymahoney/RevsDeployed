Meeting Minutes
(1) Sprint #1 Planning Meeting Notes
The team began by re-discussing our takeaways from Project 2, and what we would do to avoid the same mistakes, namely:
    We will make sure that everyone is at least familiar with both front-end and back end.
    We will be more attentive to good version control practices.
    We will ensure that more rigorous planning is done (like now).

The team then discussed what the main parts of the project would be, arriving at: Landing Customer Order, Check Out, Accessibility/Settings, Employee Login, Manager      Page (Trends, Supplier Order, Menu Settings, Employees), Cashier Page, Menu Board

Then, the team began to discuss a rough division of labor for the project:
    Alyan - Supplier Order, Scrum/PM
    Brandon - General, Landing, Accessibility
    Keeley - Employee, Inventory
    Vittoria - Trends, Menu (Manager)
    Joanne - Menu Board, Customer

The team then began to create user stories and backlog tasks.  These can be seen in detail in our project management board.  Finally, the team discussed scheduling and deadline concerns.  The team agreed to follow the Meeting Schedule detailed above and to be open to more out-of-class working sessions as needed.  The team set an initial goal to have a Minimum Viable Product by Friday afternoon, at latest.

Sprint 2 - April 8th Scrum Meeting

As a team we all gave a score of ⅖ for the question, ‘How likely are we to achieve the Sprint Goal?’. This is because one of our team members has a vital role this sprint and we must distribute her workload amongst all of us. 

This is what the team had to say about this. 
Joanne - We have to be less ambitious on our individual tasks to part to make up for the missing members tasks.
Keeley - Joanne has some difficult tasks as she is inn charge of cousomizaion, and with this extra workload, this may not be completed in this sprint. 
Brandon / Alyan - We agree with what our teammates have said. We have alot of functionality implementation in this sprint and it would be great if we could have everyone complete their parts.

For the sprint backlog breakdown, we all discussed the SPI and we also feel that we are going to stick to original backlog for rightnow as we dont have any new change which are needed for this sprint. We may add some later on within sprint 2.

April 11th

As a team we all gave a score of 3.25/5 for the question, ‘How likely are we to achieve the Sprint Goal?’. This is because one of our team members has a vital role this sprint and we must distribute her workload amongst all of us. 

This is what the team had to say about this. 
Keeley - Has been able to get a lot of work done in her freetime and is able to make up for the extra work we had for this sprint

Keeley -  Change the pricing and county of each menu item, you can add and delete ingredient quantity for each menu item, you can add and delete a menu item. Made a popup for each supplier order to see all the information related to it, all the functionality is there. Fully needs to test things as a system. Menu item, all the backend stuff is complete. You can now add a new supplier order, today she is working on vegetarian and gluten free stuff for menu items. Working on allowing to enter url and also non negative values for a price, she is adding description for menu items and lastly, error checks. 

Brandon - All database stuff is done for sprint 2. Today, brandon needs to have all the react stuff done by today, and will try to look into the google translate and oauth api. For react, make response for all pages for settings. Also making the landing page pretty. 

Joanne - Added quantity buttons to the order list on the customer order. Added a checkout opage which saves all the things ordered. Updated submit backend stuff. 

Alyan - Added in warnings for future dates for the trends, Alyan also added the dropdown for ingredients which update from the backend which then leads to an updated ingredient for the trend report. Also alyan fixed the broken excess report query and now the data shown is correct. Lastly, he is not struggling with converting from local host to render. For this fix he needs to change the port to 9000 for the pull request, and he also needs to add in router.get() in place of app.get().

Minutes from Previous Meeting
	In our last meeting, we focused extensively on planning for sprint 3, particularly in the context of reallocating tasks due to the departure of a team member. We reviewed the distribution of tasks and story points, ensuring that the workload was balanced and feasible for the remaining team members. Additionally, we discussed the completion and finalization of sprint 2, covering all the written tasks and documentation that were required for a successful close. This thorough review not only helped us secure full credit for sprint 2 but also provided crucial insights into the requirements and challenges for the upcoming sprint. Moving forward, this understanding will guide us in effectively managing our resources and expectations, aiming for continued success despite the reduced team size. Our discussion was fruitful, setting a solid foundation for the tasks and objectives we need to meet in sprint 3, with a clear focus on efficiency and collaboration.
